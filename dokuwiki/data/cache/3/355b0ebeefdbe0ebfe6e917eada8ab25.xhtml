This interface allows you to view the various logs that are written by DokuWiki. By default, there shouldn&#039;t be much
here (it depends on your <a href="https://www.dokuwiki.org/config%3Adontlog" class="interwiki iw_doku" title="https://www.dokuwiki.org/config%3Adontlog">log settings</a>). However if something goes wrong, chances are high
you&#039;ll find useful information about the problem. All times are UTC!

<p>
Please be aware that <strong>log files can contain sensitive information</strong> like passwords, paths or other secrets.
Be sure to redact the logs appropriately when posting them on the forum or in bug reports!
